# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:

Setting.create(:s1 => 'test' , :s2 => 'test', :s3 =>'test', :s4 => 'test')
